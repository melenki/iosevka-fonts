            Iosevka is a slender monospace sans-serif and slab-serif typeface
            inspired by Pragmata Pro, M+ and PF DIN Mono, designed to be the
            ideal font for programming. The font is designed by Belleve Invis.

            As the font is built entirely from code, many variations of the
            font can be maintained and developed. This allows multiple
            pre-built variants to be packaged in order to suit the users needs.
            Many of the possible variations are described below.

             - shape: the shape of various glyphs, like i, l, 0, etc.
             - spacing: how wide some specific characters are.
             - slab: whether the font has slab-serifs.
             - ligatures: whether the font contains ligatures.

            This specific package contains the Iosevka fonts. It contains the
            following variations.

             - shape: default
             - spacing: terminal
             - slab: no
             - ligatures: no
